# Claude Code Agent Instructions

## YouTrack Ticket Workflow

### Before Starting Work

1. **Ask the user for the YouTrack ticket ID or number** (e.g. "DBA-123" or just "123", which you can expand to "DBA-123"). If the YouTrack MCP is not available, refer the user to [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md) for setup instructions.

2. **If a ticket is provided:** read it with `get_issue` to understand the scope, context, and any discussion before proceeding.

3. **If no ticket exists:** propose one to the user before creating it — show a human-readable preview (summary, description, type, state, sprint) and wait for approval. Create it only after confirmation.

### Commit Messages

Always include the ticket ID in commits:
```
[DBA-123] Add support for Snowflake authentication
```

### After Creating a Pull Request

Move the associated YouTrack ticket to **Review** state using `update_issue`.

## After Completing Work

When you finish implementing changes:

1. **Run pre-commit checks:**
   ```bash
   make check
   # or directly: uv run pre-commit run --all-files
   ```

2. **Run tests:**
   ```bash
   make test
   # or directly: uv run pytest -v
   ```

3. **After checks pass**, suggest to the user that you can help create a branch, commit changes, and create a pull request.

Wait for user confirmation before proceeding.

### If User Confirms

1. **Check if GitHub CLI is installed:**
   ```bash
   gh auth status
   ```

   If not installed or not authenticated, guide the user to [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md) for setup instructions. They can also choose to create the PR manually.

2. **Determine the branch name prefix:**
   - Extract branch prefixes from existing remote branches, filtering out system prefixes (dependabot, revert-*, HEAD)
   - Use the most common matching prefix as the user's nickname
   - If no existing branches found, ask the user for their nickname
   - Branch format: `<nickname>/<descriptive-branch-name>`

   Strategy:
   ```bash
   # Extract and count branch prefixes, excluding system prefixes
   git branch -r | sed -nE 's|^ *origin/([^/]+)/.*|\1|p' | grep -vE '^(dependabot|HEAD|revert-)' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn
   ```

3. **Create a separate branch** with the appropriate prefix (never commit directly to main)

4. **Commit the changes** with clear, descriptive commit messages

5. **Create a Pull Request** with the following format:
